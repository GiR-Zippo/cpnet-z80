### Description:

This HBA target implements a serial transport over a Z80-SIO
serial port.
The default code is configured for the "serial data" Z80-SIO port on
a A5105 (BIC) (address 069H).
For most cases, the changes for different systems are
limited to SERPORT (base port address),
BAUDPRT and SERBAUD.

### Building

make NIC=ser-dri HBA=bic

### Using

Use it with unix-server in contrib directory.

Or use it with CpnetSerialServer.jar with the **cpnet_protocol** property
(or **proto=** commandline option) set to **DRI**.
